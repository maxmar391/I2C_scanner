# I2C scanner for Arduino

## Description
This repository contains the Arduino sketch for scanning the I2C bus and finding out the addresses of devices connected to the Arduino board. 

The board will check the I2C bus every 5 s for connected devices. The serial monitor will show the address of the connected devices or provide a corresponding message, if no devices is connected.

## Bill of materials
* Arduino Uno
* Any I2C device

## Procedure
* Connect your I2C device properly to your Arduino Uno board
* Open the .ino file with the Arduino IDE 
* Compile the Arduino code
* Upload the code to your Arduino Uno
* Open the serial monitor of the Arduino IDE
